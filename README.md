## Meet me

Name's Laura, pronouns are she/her.

I love programming in R and have contributed to a few CRAN-published packages. Member of [turtletopia](https://github.com/turtletopia) together with [Dominik Rafacz](https://github.com/DominikRafacz), where our future R projects will be stored. I'm quite versed in Data Science, whenever it's about data wrangling, cleaning, analyzing, modelling, or visualizing. I have some knowledge of other languages, including Python, C++, Java.

I'm partial unconstrained refactoring of code, maybe a biiit too much. I contribute to R packages I consider close enough to my coding style. A good package in my opinion has not only clean and carefully formatted code, but also extensive documentation with example usages and clever tests that do more than just cover 100% of lines (test coverage is just a number!). User of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

I'm transgender and sapphic; I believe in equal treatment for all, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, nationality, disability, and other inherent characteristics. [Intolerant of intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance). Translated most of Gender Dysphoria Bible into Polish (see [Biblia dysforii p≈Çciowej](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/pl/)).

Heavily opinionated in favour of [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma).
